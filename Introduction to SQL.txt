# What is Data?

=> Anything & Everything can be considered as data.
=> Any Information or fact can be considered as data.
=> For an insurance company , details related to its employees, customers, their products or even their address can be data.
=> Data can be in any form such as a text msg, an image or a video or a document or a single character itself.

# What is a Databas?

=> A container which is filled with data or information which is electronically stored in a computer system.
=> Dat in any form can be stored in the database.
=> All companies use database to store the information /data.
=> Purpose of storing data in database is:
  * Easily Accessed
  * Modified
  * Protected
  * Analyzed

# What is SQL?

=> Structured Query Language(SQL). Also referred to as "SEQUEL".
=> It is a language to interact with RDBMS.
=> All major RDBMS like Oracle , MySQL. MSSQL, PostgreSQL etc uses SQL.

=> USING SQL, We can:
	->Read data from RDBMS
	->Write data into RDBMS
	->Create, modify or delete database
	->Analyze data
	->Build reports

# How data is stored in RDBMS 

=> In RDBMS , data is stored in multiple tables. Each table can have a set of rows and columns. Different tables will be related to each other through certain
 columns forming relationship between these tables.

SQL Commands

1) DDL(DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE): Used to define the structur of database object such as tables, views, Procedurs and functions.DDL is a set of SQL commands 
used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data
 
List of DDL commands: 

1) CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
2) DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
3) ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
4) TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
5) COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
6) RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.


2) DML(Data Manipulation Language): The SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or 
Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data 
and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

List of DML commands: 

1) INSERT: It is used to insert data into a table.
2) UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
3) DELETE: It is used to delete records from a database table.


3) DCL (Data Control Language): DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls 
of the database system. 

List of  DCL commands: 

1) GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.
2) REVOKE: This command withdraws the userâ€™s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.


4) TCL (Transaction Control Language): Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. Each transaction begins with a specific task 
and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully complete.
 If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure.
 You can explore more about transactions here. Hence, the following TCL commands are used to control the execution of a transaction: 

1) COMMIT: Commits a Transaction.
2) ROLLBACK: Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
3) SAVEPOINT: Sets a save point within a transaction.


5) DQL (Data Query Language): DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.
 The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it.

List of DQL: 

1) SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.
